# projects-management-system
- I have made this project as a part of my Django learning process.
- This project involves creating employee or interns along with assigning them some projects and tasks. Authenticated users can see all the active projects with some description and task with deadlines. Company's members can edit project details as per status of project : Active, Stuck or Done.
- Whole backend is written in Python language on Django framework, and for frontend I have used HTML, CSS and js (Basically just did `ctrl + c` and `ctrl + v`).
- To store data, I have used mysql and on localhost with phpmyadmin to interact with.
- Future aspects of this project would be to integrate it with AWS or Heroku and can use as internal company's project management system.
